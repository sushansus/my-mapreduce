# My mapreduce

# The project will open with Java complier
Determine the passenger(s) having had the highest number of flights.
For this task in the development process, develop a MapReduce-like executable prototype, (in Java, C, C++, or Python). The objective is to develop the basic functional ‘building-blocks’ that addresses the Task above, in a way that emulates the MapReduce/Hadoop framework.
The solution uses multi-threading as required. The marking scheme reflects the appropriate use of coding techniques, succinct code comments as required, data structures and overall program design.


The code was developed using a Java IDE, and it is essential to set up the correct directory paths for the program to function properly. Additionally, the installed JDK must be configured. Upon executing the program, the test results will be displayed, showcasing the passengers with the highest number of flights..
